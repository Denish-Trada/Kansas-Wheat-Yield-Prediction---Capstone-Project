## üåæ Project Summary

Accurate prediction of wheat crop yields is crucial for farm profitability, food security, and supply chain planning in Kansas and beyond.  
This project leverages 10 years of historical county-level wheat yield, weather, and soil data to build robust, interpretable machine learning models for yield forecasting.  
The final solution is delivered both as a transparent Jupyter notebook workflow and a user-friendly web dashboard, enabling actionable insights and scenario planning for growers, cooperatives, and agribusiness leaders.

## üìà Problem Statement

**How can we predict wheat yield (tons per hectare) for Kansas counties, using historical weather, soil, and farm management data?**  
Key goals:
- Enable data-driven decisions for Kansas wheat farmers, cooperatives, and advisors.
- Identify the most impactful, actionable yield drivers.
- Deliver a transparent model and digital product that is practical for real-world use.

## üß† Approach

1. **Data Wrangling:**  
   - Cleaned, validated, and merged all raw data sources.
   - Built a consistent schema for machine learning and business use.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Applied formal hypothesis testing, visual analytics, and feature selection.
   - Identified **rainfall** and **fertilizer use** as the dominant, actionable yield drivers.

3. **Modeling:**  
   - Developed and benchmarked multiple regression models: linear, ridge, lasso, random forest.
   - Performed extensive cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
   - Used SHAP explainability to visualize and interpret model decisions.

4. **Scenario Analysis:**  
   - Simulated ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios to show how changes in rainfall or fertilizer use impact yield.

5. **Productization:**  
   - Developed a Streamlit web dashboard allowing end-users to input scenarios, see predictions, and get actionable recommendations and feature driver explanations.

## üåü Key Highlights

- **Model Accuracy:**  
  - Final model (Ridge Regression): **R¬≤ = 0.78**, **RMSE = 0.79 tons/ha**
  - Delivers reliable yield forecasts with clear, business-focused interpretability.

- **Top Insights:**  
  - **Rainfall** is the single strongest predictor of yield.
  - **Fertilizer use** consistently boosts yields by about 1.5 tons/ha.
  - Other variables (region, soil type, weather condition, temperature) had minimal impact in this dataset.

- **Business Value:**  
  - Farmers and co-ops can focus on rainfall monitoring and optimal fertilizer use for the best ROI.
  - Dashboard delivers instant, transparent yield forecasts and ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario planning.
  - Project empowers evidence-based decision making, with explainability for stakeholder trust.
